About
=======

Eternal Items mod adds quite a lot of known items to a single mod.

Whether you want Ingots, Gears, Ore Blocks and even Raw Ores, you will find 'almost' EVERYTHING in one spot!

We even have quite a lot of NEW Items for you use!

**Note**: These items DO NOT HAVE a recipe included, items such as Gears, Ingots, Ore Blocks and Raw Ores do have a recipe!
But this mod was created with the intent to be used in --LOTS-- of Modpacks, but ||**Catalyst Evolution Modpack**|| is the main focus of this mod.

We also added new items for known mods like:

**Ars Nouveau**,
**Applied Energistics 2** (NYI),
**EvilCraft** (NIY),
**EnderIO** (NYI),
**GregTech**,
**Mekanism**,
**Occultism**,
**Productive Bees** (NYI),

KubeJS
============

As mentioned before, some items don't include a recipe, but you can add them with **KubeJS** to add an useful functionality and RECIPE.
