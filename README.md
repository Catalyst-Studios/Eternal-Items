Translation to other Languages
=============

This mod ships in with English & Spanish translations by default!

With the Translations you are free to contribute without asking me, simply create a PR over Github and we'll gladly look at it.

However, make sure to **NOT USE ANY TYPE OF AI ON IT**!!!

We are looking for people that actually speak that language. We love machine, but not that kind of machine!
